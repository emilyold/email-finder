# email-finder
Crawler to find all email addresses on a website

This is a maven command line application. In order to run, you must have maven installed acording the instructions found here: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

Once maven is configured correctly there are two applications which can be run depending on the format of the website you are hoping to search. If the website has statically defined html, the EmailScraper should be used. This application requires a single argument: the url of the website you wish to search.
